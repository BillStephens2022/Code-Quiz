# Code-Quiz

## Description

This website is a timed Quiz Game with multiple choice questions about web development.  The game has questions that are dynamically rendered onto the page using Javascript.  Questions and answers slide onto the screen using CSS animation.  As the player answers questions, a fun soundclip is played indicating whether the answer is correct or not. Time is deducted for incorrect answers. At the end of the game, the player is asked to input their initials and it keeps track of scores on local storage.
